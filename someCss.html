        <h1>Hi, This is Jingshan! Here are some of my CSS work from Level 1 to 3:

	    <h2>Level 1: Newbie.</h2>
        <h3>Here are two paragraphs that each have a different font.</h3>
	    <p class="p1">Futures contracts tied to the major U.S. stock indexes ticked higher at the start of the overnight session Wednesday evening, suggesting that Wall Street could extend gains that have propelled the S&P 500 to record levels this week.</p>
        <p class="p2">The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.1% even as Big Tech stocks outperformed. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet all climbed more than 1%, while Facebook jumped 2.2%.</p>
        <h3>Then, two pictures that were originally different sizes, resized to 50px by 50px.</h3>

        <h3>Here is a paragraph with the specific outline, which has not be covered in class.</h3>
        <p class="p3">The proposed increase to the corporate tax is thought to be a key source of tax revenue for the White House infrastructure plan and is a non-starter for Republicans, who say they are concerned about tax increases as the U.S. economy emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>Level 2: Apprentice.</h2>
        <h3>First, here's text that is centered on a photo.</h3>
        <div class="container">

            <div class="centered">Hi, I'm the text that is centered on this photo of snow.</div>

        <h3>Third, here's text with a border that uses dotted lines.</h3>
        <p class="p4">On Thursday, investors will pore over the Labor Departmentâ€™s latest update on the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect first-time claims to total 694,000 during the week ended April 3.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Level 3: Master.</h2>
        <h3>First, you can access the external style sheet with the link I provide on gClass.</h3>
        <h3>Second, here's a float element. The image will float to the left in the text, and the text in the paragraph will wrap around the image.</h3>
        <p class="p1"><img class="img3" src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-69876233/69876233.jpg?506233" alt="Pineaple">
